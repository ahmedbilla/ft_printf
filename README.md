# ft_printf

ft_printf is a project that focuses on implementing a simplified version of the printf function from the C standard library. The goal is to create a custom function capable of formatting and printing various types of data, such as integers, strings, characters, and more, using format specifiers like %d, %s, %c, etc.

The main objectives of ft_printf include:

Understanding how to manage variable arguments with va_list in C.
Working with different format specifiers and flags (like -, +, 0, etc.).
Gaining a deeper understanding of string manipulation and memory handling.
This project allows developers to improve their skills in handling formatted output and variable argument lists while building a reusable and efficient custom function for output formatting.
